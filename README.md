# CMake Tools

Quick test run of the CMake Tools VS Code extension.

## About CMake Tools

[CMake Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools) is a VS-Code Extension provided by Microsoft that provides a workflow for CMake-based projects. CMake Tools do not provide support for CMake scripting hence I also have the extension[CMake twxs](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=twxs.cmake) enabled, that provides CMake language support for VS-Code.
